# This notebook develops all the Gentrification index creation.

It contains several sections, first exploring each of the datasets (Business licenses, Building permits and Rent) as well as the zip code information.

After that we create two indexes, one of them including rent prices (which implies losing some zip codes) and another one that does not include rent increase. 

Finally we do some validation by comparing to the Furman Center map. For this validation we use mainly the index that includes the rent increase.
